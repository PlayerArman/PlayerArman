My name is Arman, and I'm a tech enthusiast who's passionate about programming. I'm currently enrolling in a computer engineering university and learning Swift, Python and C++, and I'm always looking for ways to further my knowledge in the field. I'm particularly interested in AI programming and AR, as I believe these technologies have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with computers. I enjoy exploring new concepts and experimenting with different approaches to problem-solving, and I'm excited to see where my journey in programming will take me.
